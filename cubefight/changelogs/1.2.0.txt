Hey again! :D

This update brings a lot of changes, bug fixes, and additions. The main additions are lasers! Which you can adjust in settings from the lobby. Additionally, you now don't have to forward ports, or use for example hamachi! Cube Fight is using UPnP from now which will allow you to just press host, send IP to your friend, and here you go! If your router of course supports that (most are). Okay UPnP aside, a new map Skyscape is added too! That's it from me, full changelog here it is:
